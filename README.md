# Dropnote

## Introduction

[Dropnote](http://dropnote.today) - your personal coffee brewings diary.

Download on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dropnote-coffee-brewing-notebook/id1112293581).

## Why is it public repo?

There are a few reasons. The main one is sharing knowledge and opinions.

I'd like to learn throught discussions, open issues and code/design changes.
I hope that it may also be a learning opportunity or interesting experience for others.

If you want to know more about code base, its design and used patterns (or made mistakes) take a look at [app design page](APPDESIGN.md).

## Installation

- Clone the repo to working directory
- Dependencies are managed with [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org), so you have to run:
```
pod install
```
If you don't have CocoaPods installed, run:
```
[sudo] gem install cocoapods
```
- Open the `Brewer.xcworkspace` in Xcode:  
```
open Brewer.xcworkspace
```

### What does _Brewer_ name refer to?

_Brewer_ is the initial name (current code name) of the project. _Dropnote_ was made up much later.

## Planned features

Look [here](https://github.com/Dropnote/Dropnote-iOS/issues/2).

## Contributing

Honestly, I don't expect much contribution in this personal project, but if you find a bug I'd appreciate an issue or pull request.

Primarily, I'd love to hear feedback about code design or used solutions.
